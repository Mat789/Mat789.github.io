		<h2>Scope & Topics</h2>
		<p>The goal of the track is to reflect the main lines of investigation in Sliding Mode Control including:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Homogeneous and bi-homogeneous sliding mode algorithms (continuous and discontinuous)</li>
		  <li>Sliding mode-based observation, identification, fault detection and fault-tolerant control</li>
		  <li>Chattering analysis and adjustment in both frequency domain and state-space</li>
		  <li>Discrete sliding modes</li>
		  <li>Adaptation of sliding mode control algorithms</li>
		  <li>Applications of sliding mode control: control of underactuated systems, aerospace applications, networked control, event-triggered control, and others</li>
		</ul>
